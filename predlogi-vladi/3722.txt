V slovensko prakso se je zažrl princip najnižje cene pri izbiri izvajalca. Najbolj katastrofalne posledice so seveda pri izbiri izvajalcev inženirskih storitev. Prilagam principe izbire konzultanta, ki veljajo za financiranje iz virov islamske razvojne banke (ostale mednarodne banke imajo podobne kriterije).

General Principles of Consultants Selection 
 1.8  Some common principles apply to the selection of consultants under IDB 
financing. 
 (a)  The Beneficiary is responsible for  the selection and employment of the 
consultant and administering the contract, and shall assure the transparency of 
the selection procedure. 
(b)  The selection of a consultant shall  be based foremost on its technical 
qualifications, because its expertise and  skill will to a large extent determine 
the satisfactory completion of a project. Price considerations are often part of 
the selection procedure as well, but are of lesser importance compared to the 
total cost of a project, which could be substantially higher if the technical 
design proves deficient. Therefore, for most assignments, both the technical 
quality and the remuneration of the consultant are considered in the selection 
method (Quality and Cost-Based Selection or QCBS), but the technical quality 
is accorded a proportionally higher weight. For projects where the technical 
quality of consulting services is paramount, it may be appropriate to carry out 
the selection solely on the basis of technical quality (Quality-Based 
Selection or QBS).
