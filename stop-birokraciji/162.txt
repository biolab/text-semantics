I have a business in Maribor, but am english and before that had businesses in the UK.  I was shocked by how complicated it is to employ people in Slovenia.  Everywhere around people are working in the black economy because it is not just expensive but complicated to employ people.  I make the following suggestions based on comparing slovenia with the UK> 1. when paying prispevki for employees, you should not have to make numerous (some 13?)different payment but one and at the end of the year you could send a report outlining how that figure was arrived at, allowing the various departments to receive their share of the money, or just throw it all together! 2. taking on an employee should not be so complicated. too much paperwork 3. regres, payment of, caused me to end the contracts of staff i could not afford.  i could only just pay normal wages, regres was a real problem.   4. sick pay.  i could not afford to pay the wages of staff who were ill and pay for their replacement.  i closed my business shortly after a member of staff was ill for 6 weeks.   sick pay is ok, but it is too high.  in the uk it is similar to unemployment pay and paid by the government
