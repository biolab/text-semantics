On June 23, 2011, a handful of visionary and courageous Members of  Congress, led by Rep. Barney Frank, introduced the "Ending Federal  Marijuana Prohibition Act of 2011," a bill that would treat marijuana  the way alcohol is treated under federal law. It would give each state  complete freedom to regulate marijuana in the manner it believes is in  the best interests of its citizens. If a state wants to make marijuana  available to patients, it can. And if it prefers to make marijuana legal  for all adults, it can do that, too. Hundreds of billions of  dollars have been wasted on marijuana prohibition over the past forty  years. And for what? Usage rates don't change. The price of marijuana  doesn't change. All prohibition has done is ensure that profits have  remained underground while marijuana itself has been unregulated and  less safe. It is time to tell your representative in Congress to  put an end to this massive waste of government resources. States must be  set free to experiment with marijuana policy.
